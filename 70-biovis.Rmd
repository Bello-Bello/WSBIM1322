# Visualising biomolecular data {#sec:biovis}

The goal of this chapter is to learn some additional visualisation
that are widely used in biomedical data analysis, namely

- **Heatmaps**, including an application of the hierarchical
  clustering that was seen in chapter \@ref(sec:ul).
- Visualisation of intersections, in particular **Venn** and **UpSet**
  plots.
- The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Gviz")` to visualise genomic data.

## Heatmaps

Heatmaps (plus ex on effect of distances and scaling)


## Visualising sets


## Data along genomic corrdinates
