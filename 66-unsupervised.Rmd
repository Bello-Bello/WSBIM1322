## Introduction

After learing about dimensionality reduction and PCA, in this chapter
we will focus on **clustering**. The goal of clustering algorithms is
to find homogeneous subgroups within the data; the grouping is based
on similiarities (or distance) between observations. The result of a
clustering algorithm is to group the observations (features) into
distinct (generally non-overlapping) groups. These groups are, even of
imperfect (i.e. ignoring intermediate states) are often very useful in
interpretation and assessment of the data.

In this chapter we will:

- Learn how to use a widely used non-parametric clustering algorithms
  **k-means**.
- Learn how to use reucrsive clustering approaches known as
  **hierarchical clustering**.
- 
- Observe the clustering parameters and distance metrics influence of
  outputs of these algorithms.

## k-means clustering

The k-means clustering algorithms aims at partitioning *n*
observations into a fixed number of *k* clusters. The algorithm will
find homogeneous clusters.

In R, we use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stats::kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
```

where 

- `x` is a numeric data matrix
- `centers` is the pre-defined number of clusters
- the k-means algorithm has a random component and can be repeated
  `nstart` times to improve the returned model

```{r solirisx, echo=FALSE}
i <- grep("Length", names(iris))
x <- iris[, i]
```

```{r solkmcl, echo=FALSE}
cl <- kmeans(x, 3, nstart = 10)
```

plot(x, col = cl$cluster)
```

```{r soliris, eval=FALSE}
i <- grep("Length", names(iris))
x <- iris[, i]
cl <- kmeans(x, 3, nstart = 10)
plot(x, col = cl$cluster)
```
</details>

### How does k-means work

**Initialisation**: randomly assign class membership


```{r kmworksinit, fig.cap="k-means random intialisation"}
set.seed(12)
init <- sample(3, nrow(x), replace = TRUE)
plot(x, col = init)
```

**Iteration**:

1. Calculate the centre of each subgroup as the average position of
   all observations is that subgroup.
2. Each observation is then assigned to the group of its nearest
   centre.
 
It's also possible to stop the algorithm after a certain number of
iterations, or once the centres move less than a certain distance.

```{r kmworksiter, fig.width = 12, fig.cap="k-means iteration: calculate centers (left) and assign new cluster membership (right)"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x, col = init)
centres <- sapply(1:3, function(i) colMeans(x[init == i, ], ))
centres <- t(centres)
points(centres[, 1], centres[, 2], pch = 19, col = 1:3)

tmp <- dist(rbind(centres, x))
tmp <- as.matrix(tmp)[, 1:3]

ki <- apply(tmp, 1, which.min)
ki <- ki[-(1:3)]

plot(x, col = ki)
points(centres[, 1], centres[, 2], pch = 19, col = 1:3)
```

**Termination**: Repeat iteration until no point changes its cluster
membership.

### Model selection

Due to the random initialisation, one can obtain different clustering
results. When k-means is run multiple times, the best outcome,
i.e. the one that generates the smallest *total within cluster sum of
squares (SS)*, is selected. The total within SS is calculated as:

For each cluster results:

- for each observation, determine the squared euclidean distance from
  observation to centre of cluster
- sum all distances

Note that this is a **local minimum**; there is no guarantee to obtain
a global minimum.

```{r selrep, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = "Different k-means results on the same (random) data"}
cl1 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
cl2 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)

cl1 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
cl2 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)

set.seed(42)
xr <- matrix(rnorm(prod(dim(x))), ncol = ncol(x))
cl1 <- kmeans(xr, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
cl2 <- kmeans(xr, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)
diffres <- cl1$cluster != cl2$cluster
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(xr, col = cl1$cluster, pch = ifelse(diffres, 19, 1))
plot(xr, col = cl2$cluster, pch = ifelse(diffres, 19, 1))
```
</details>

### How to determine the number of clusters

1. Run k-means with `k=1`, `k=2`, ..., `k=n`
2. Record total within SS for each value of k.
3. Choose k at the *elbow* position, as illustrated below.

```{r kmelbow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = ""}
ks <- 1:5
tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(x, k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})
plot(ks, tot_within_ss, type = "b",
     ylab = "Total within squared distances",
     xlab = "Values of k tested")
```

> Challenge

> Calculate the total within sum of squares for k from 1 to 5 for our
> `x` test data, and reproduce the figure above. 

<details>
```{r solkmelbow}
ks <- 1:5
tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(x, k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})
plot(ks, tot_within_ss, type = "b")
```

## Hierarchical clustering

### How does hierarchical clustering work

**Initialisation**:  Starts by assigning each of the n points its own cluster

**Iteration**

1. Find the two nearest clusters, and join them together, leading to
   n-1 clusters
2. Continue the cluster merging process until all are grouped into a
   single cluster

**Termination:** All observations are grouped within a single cluster.

```{r hcldata, fig.width = 12, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hierarchical clustering: initialisation (left) and colour-coded results after iteration (right)."}
set.seed(42)
xr <- data.frame(x = rnorm(5),
                 y = rnorm(5))
cls <- c("red", "blue", "orange", "blue", "orange")
cls <- scales::col2hcl(cls, alpha = 0.5)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(xr, cex = 3)
text(xr$x, xr$y, 1:5)
plot(xr, cex = 3, col = cls, pch = 19)
text(xr$x, xr$y, 1:5)
```

The results of hierarchical clustering are typically visualised along
a **dendrogram**, where the distance between the clusters is
proportional to the branch lengths.


```{r hcldendro, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Visualisation of the hierarchical clustering results on a dendrogram"}
plot(hcr <- hclust(dist(xr)))
```

In R:

- Calculate the distance using `dist`, typically the Euclidean
  distance.
- Hierarchical clustering on this distance matrix using `hclust`

> Challenge
> 
> Apply hierarchical clustering on the `iris` data and generate a
> dendrogram using the dedicated `plot` method.

<details>
```{r hclsol, fig.cap = ""}
d <- dist(iris[, 1:4])
hcl <- hclust(d)
hcl
plot(hcl)
```
</details>

### Defining clusters

After producing the hierarchical clustering result, we need to *cut
the tree (dendrogram)* at a specific height to defined the
clusters. For example, on our test dataset above, we could decide to
cut it at a distance around 1.5, with would produce 2 clusters.

```{r cuthcl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Cutting the dendrogram at height 1.5."}
plot(hcr)
abline(h = 1.5, col = "red")
```

In R we can us the `cutree` function to

- cut the tree at a specific height: `cutree(hcl, h = 1.5)`
- cut the tree to get a certain number of clusters: `cutree(hcl, k = 2)`

> Challenge
> 
> - Cut the iris hierarchical clustering result at a height to obtain
>   3 clusters by setting `h`.
> - Cut the iris hierarchical clustering result at a height to obtain
>   3 clusters by setting directly `k`, and verify that both provide
>   the same results.


<details>
```{r cuthclsol}
plot(hcl)
abline(h = 3.9, col = "red")
cutree(hcl, k = 3)
cutree(hcl, h = 3.9)
identical(cutree(hcl, k = 3), cutree(hcl, h = 3.9))
```
</details>


> Challenge
> 
> Using the same value `k = 3`, verify if k-means and hierarchical
> clustering produce the same results on the `iris` data.
> 
> Which one, if any, is correct?


<details>
```{r iris2algs, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = ""}
km <- kmeans(iris[, 1:4], centers = 3, nstart = 10)
hcl <- hclust(dist(iris[, 1:4]))
table(km$cluster, cutree(hcl, k = 3))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length, col = km$cluster, main = "k-means")
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length, col = cutree(hcl, k = 3), main = "Hierarchical clustering")
## Checking with the labels provided with the iris data
table(iris$Species, km$cluster)
table(iris$Species, cutree(hcl, k = 3))
```
</details>

## Pre-processing

Many of the machine learning methods that are regularly used are
sensitive to difference scales. This applies to unsupervised methods
as well as supervised methods, as we will see in the next chapter.

A typical way to pre-process the data prior to learning is to scale
the data, or apply principal component analysis (next section). Scaling
assures that all data columns have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

In R, scaling is done with the `scale` function.

> Challenge

> Using the `mtcars` data as an example, verify that the variables are
> of different scales, then scale the data. To observe the effect
> different scales, compare the hierarchical clusters obtained on the
> original and scaled data.

<details>
```{r scalesol, fig.width=12, fig.cap=""}
colMeans(mtcars)
hcl1 <- hclust(dist(mtcars))
hcl2 <- hclust(dist(scale(mtcars)))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(hcl1, main = "original data")
plot(hcl2, main = "scaled data")
```
</details>



## Additional exercises

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
An important caveat of clustering is that a clustering algorithm such
as *k-means* will always find clusters, even when there is
none. Illustrate this by creating a 2-dimensional random data by
generation a matrix of 100 rows and 2 columns from *N(0, 1)* and
searching for 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cluster. Visualise these results and assess
whether they look convincing or not.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


```{r, include = FALSE}
xy <- matrix(rnorm(200), ncol = 2)
kcl2 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 2)
kcl3 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 3)
kcl4 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 4)
kcl5 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 5)
kcl6 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 6)
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot(xy)
plot(xy, col = kcl2$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl3$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl4$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl5$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl6$cluster)
```
