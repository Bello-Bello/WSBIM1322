# Unsupervised learning: clustering {#sec:ul}

## Introduction

After learing about dimensionality reduction and PCA, in this chapter
we will focus on **clustering**. The goal of clustering algorithms is
to find homogeneous subgroups within the data; the grouping is based
on similiarities (or distance) between observations. The result of a
clustering algorithm is to group the observations (features) into
distinct (generally non-overlapping) groups. These groups are, even of
imperfect (i.e. ignoring intermediate states) are often very useful in
interpretation and assessment of the data.


In this chapter we will:

- Introduce clustering methods.
- Learn how to use a widely used non-parametric clustering algorithms
  **k-means**.
- Learn how to use reucrsive clustering approaches known as
  **hierarchical clustering**.
- Observe the influence of clustering parameters and distance metrics
  on the outputs.
- Provide real-life example of how to apply clustering on omics data.

## How to measure similarities?

Clustering algorithms reply on a measurement of similarity between
between features to group them into clusters. An important step is
thus to decide how to measure these similarities. A range of distance
measurements are available:

The **Euclidean** distance between two points $A = (a_{1}, \ldots , a_{p})$ and 
$B = (b_{1}, \ldots , b_{p})$ in a $p$-dimensional space (for the $p$ features) 
is the square root of the sum of squares of the differences in all 
$p$ coordinate directions:

$$ d(A, B) = \sqrt{ (a_{1} - b_{1})^{2} + (a_{2} - b_{2})^{2} + \ldots + (a_{p} - b_{p})^{2} } $$

The **Minkovski** allows the exponent to be $m$ instead of 2, as in the Euclidean distance:

$$ d(A, B) = ( (a_{1} - b_{1})^{m} + (a_{2} - b_{2})^{m} + \ldots + (a_{p} - b_{p})^{m} )^{\frac{1}{m}} $$

The **maximum** (or $L_{\inf}$) distance is the maximum of the absolute differences
between coordinates:

$$ d(A, B) = max_{i} | a_{i} − b_{i} | $$

The **Manhattan** (or City Block, Taxicab or $L_{1}$) distance takes the sum of the
absolute differences in all coordinates:

$$ d(A, B) = | a_{1} − b_{1} | + | a_{2} − b_{2} | + \ldots + |a_{p} − b_{p}| $$

When computing a **binary** distance, the vectors are regarded as
binary bits, with non-zero elements are *on* and zero elements are
*off*.  The distance is the proportion of bits in which only one is on
amongst those in which at least one is on. For example, the binary
distance between vectors `x` and `y` is 0.4 because out of the 5 pairs
of bits that have at least on *1* (all but the second elements), 2
have only on (the first and fifth).

```{r}
x <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
y <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1)
```


The **canberra** distance, that computes the sum of the difference to
the sum of each the elements of vectors:

$$ \sum{ \frac{ | x_{i} - y_{i} | }{ | x_{i} | + | y_{i} | } } $$

<!-- Correlation based distance: -->

These are some of the distances available in the `dist` function. See
also section 5.3 from [@MSMB] for additional details.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Generate the 5 data points along 2 dimensions as illustrated below and
calculate all their euclidean pairwise distance using `dist`. Interprete the
output of the function. What class if it?

```{r, fig.cap = "A simulated dataset composed of 5 samples."}
set.seed(111)
samples <- data.frame(x = rnorm(5, 5, 1),
                      y = rnorm(5, 5, 1))
plot(samples, cex = 3)
text(samples$x, samples$y, 1:5)
```
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
dist(samples) 
class(dist(samples))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Calculate the position of the *average sample*, visualise it on the
figure above. Which samples are respectively the closest and furthers
to the *average sample*?

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r, fig.cap = "Visualisation of the average sample, in red."}
avg_sample <- colMeans(samples)
plot(samples, cex = 3)
text(samples$x, samples$y, 1:5)
points(avg_sample["x"], avg_sample["y"], pch = 19, col = "red", cex = 2)
```
```{r}
(dists <- dist(rbind(samples, avg_sample)))
dists <- as.matrix(dists)
d6 <- dists[6, -6]
which.min(d6) ## closest
which.max(d6) ## furthers
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


## k-means clustering

The k-means clustering algorithm[^learnkmean] aims at partitioning *n*
observations into a fixed number of *k* clusters. This algorithm will
find homogeneous clusters.

[^learnkmean]: We will learn how the algorithm works below.

In R, we use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stats::kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
```

where 

- `x` is a numeric data matrix
- `centers` is the pre-defined number of clusters
- the k-means algorithm has a random component and can be repeated
  `nstart` times to improve the returned model

To learn about k-means, let's use the `giris` dataset, that provides
the expression of 4 genes in 150 patients grouped in categories A, B
or C.

```{r girisplot, fig.cap = "The *giris* dataset describes 150 patients by the expression of 4 genes. Each patient was assigned a grade A, B or C."}
library("rWSBIM1322")
data(giris)
pairs(giris, col = giris$GRADE)
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Run the k-means algorithm on the `giris` data, save the results in a
new variable `cl`, and explore its output when printed. What is the
class of `cl`?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r solkmcl1}
cl <- kmeans(giris[, -5], 3, nstart = 10)
class(cl)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
The actual results of the algorithms, i.e. the cluster membership can
be accessed in the `cluster` element of the clustering result
output. Extract and interpret these data.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r solkmcl2}
cl$cluster
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Produce 2 PCA plots, colouring one with the original grade, and the
other one with the results of the clustering algorithm. Compare the
two plots.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r solkmcl3, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "PCA analysis of the `giris` data, highlighting the original groups (left) and the clustering results (right).", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
pca <- prcomp(giris[, -5], scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
summary(pca)

library("factoextra")
library("patchwork")
p1 <- fviz_pca(pca, habillage = giris$GRADE)
p2 <- fviz_pca(pca, habillage = cl$cluster)
p1 / p2
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Compare the categories and clustering results and count the number of
matches/mismatches.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r solkmcl4}
table(giris$GRADE, cl$cluster)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

### How does k-means work {-}

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Start from a matrix of *n* features in *p* observations.
2. **Initisalistion**: randomly assign the *p* obervations to *k*
   clusters.
3. **Iteration (1)**: Calculate the centre of each subgroup as the
   average position of all observations is that subgroup.
4. **Iteration (2)**: Each observation is then assigned to the group
   of its nearest centre.
5. **Termination**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until no obervation changes its
   cluster membership.

**Initialisation**: randomly assign class membership

```{r kmworksinit, fig.cap="k-means random intialisation", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 9, fig.heigth = 4}
set.seed(12)
x <- data.frame(pca$x[, 1:2])
x$init <- sample(LETTERS[1:3], nrow(x), replace = TRUE)
p1 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = init)) +
    geom_point() + 
    labs(title = "Initialisation") 
p1
```

**Iteration**:

1. Calculate the centre of each subgroup as the average position of
   all observations is that subgroup.
2. Each observation is then assigned to the group of its nearest
   centre.
 
It's also possible to stop the algorithm after a certain number of
iterations, or once the centres move less than a certain distance.

```{r kmworksiter, fig.cap="k-means iteration: calculate centers (left) and assign new cluster membership (right)", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
centres <- x %>%
    group_by(init) %>%
    summarise(PC1 = mean(PC1),
              PC2 = mean(PC2)) %>%
    select(PC1, PC2, init)

p2 <- p1 +
    labs(title = "Initialisation with centres") + 
    geom_point(data = centres, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, col = init),
               shape  = 1, size = 5) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")    


tmp <- as.matrix((rbind(centres[, 1:2], x[, 1:2])))
tmp <- dist(tmp)
tmp <- as.matrix(tmp)[, 1:3]
ki <- apply(tmp, 1, which.min)
ki <- LETTERS[1:3][ki]
x$iter <- ki[-(1:3)]

p3 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = iter)) +
    labs(title = "Iteration 1") +   
    geom_point() +
    geom_point(data = centres, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, col = init),
               shape  = 1, size = 5) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
p2 / p3
```

**Termination**: Repeat iteration until no point changes its cluster
membership.

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="k-means convergence (credit Wikipedia).", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/K-means_convergence.gif")
```

### Model selection

Due to the random initialisation, one can obtain different clustering
results. 

```{r, fig.cap = "Different k-means results on the same `girsi` data", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
## set.seed(23)
set.seed(211)
cl1 <- kmeans(giris[, -5], centers = 3, nstart = 1)
cl2 <- kmeans(giris[, -5], centers = 3, nstart = 1)
 table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)
x <- data.frame(pca$x[, 1:2])
x$kmeans_1 <- LETTERS[1:3][cl1$cluster]
x$kmeans_2 <- LETTERS[1:3][cl2$cluster]
p1 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = PC1, PC2, colour = kmeans_1)) +
    geom_point()
p2 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = PC1, PC2, colour = kmeans_2)) +
    geom_point()
p1 / p2
```

When k-means is run multiple times (as set by `nstart`), the best
outcome, i.e. the one that generates the smallest *total within
cluster sum of squares (SS)*, is selected. The total within SS is
calculated as:

For each cluster results:

- for each observation, determine the squared euclidean distance from
  observation to centre of cluster
- sum all distances

Note that this is a **local minimum**; there is no guarantee to obtain
a global minimum.


### How to determine the number of clusters

1. Run k-means with `k=1`, `k=2`, ..., `k=n`
2. Record total within SS for each value of k.
3. Choose k at the *elbow* position, as illustrated below.

```{r kmelbow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Total within sum of squared distances for different values is *k*."}
ks <- data.frame(k = 1:5)
ks$tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks$k, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(giris[, -5], k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})

ggplot(ks, aes(x = k, y = tot_within_ss)) +
    geom_line() + geom_point()
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Calculate the total within sum of squares for k from 1 to 5 for our
`giris` test data, and reproduce the figure above.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r solkmelbow}
ks <- 1:5
tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(giris[, -5], k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})
plot(ks, tot_within_ss, type = "b")
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

## Hierarchical clustering

### How does hierarchical clustering work

**Initialisation**:  Starts by assigning each of the n points its own cluster

**Iteration**

1. Find the two nearest clusters, and join them together, leading to
   n-1 clusters
2. Continue the cluster merging process until all are grouped into a
   single cluster

**Termination:** All observations are grouped within a single cluster.

```{r hcldata, fig.width = 12, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hierarchical clustering: initialisation (left) and colour-coded results after iteration (right)."}
set.seed(42)
xr <- data.frame(x = rnorm(5),
                 y = rnorm(5))
cls <- c("red", "blue", "orange", "blue", "orange")
cls <- scales::col2hcl(cls, alpha = 0.5)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(xr, cex = 3)
text(xr$x, xr$y, 1:5)
plot(xr, cex = 3, col = cls, pch = 19)
text(xr$x, xr$y, 1:5)
```

The results of hierarchical clustering are typically visualised along
a **dendrogram**, where the distance between the clusters is
proportional to the branch lengths.


```{r hcldendro, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Visualisation of the hierarchical clustering results on a dendrogram"}
plot(hcr <- hclust(dist(xr)))
```

In R:

- Calculate the distance using `dist`, typically the Euclidean
  distance.
- Hierarchical clustering on this distance matrix using `hclust`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Apply hierarchical clustering on the `giris` data and generate a
dendrogram using the dedicated `plot` method.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r hclsol, fig.cap = ""}
d <- dist(giris[, -5])
hcl <- hclust(d)
hcl
plot(hcl)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

### Defining clusters

After producing the hierarchical clustering result, we need to *cut
the tree (dendrogram)* at a specific height to defined the
clusters. For example, on our test dataset above, we could decide to
cut it at a distance around 1.5, with would produce 2 clusters.

```{r cuthcl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Cutting the dendrogram at height 1.5."}
plot(hcl)
abline(h = 1.5, col = "red")
```

In R we can us the `cutree` function to

- cut the tree at a specific height: `cutree(hcl, h = 1.5)`
- cut the tree to get a certain number of clusters: `cutree(hcl, k = 3)`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Cut the iris hierarchical clustering result at a height to obtain
  3 clusters by setting `h`.
  
- Cut the iris hierarchical clustering result at a height to obtain
  3 clusters by setting directly `k`, and verify that both provide
  the same results.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r cuthclsol}
plot(hcl)
abline(h = 3.9, col = "red")
cutree(hcl, k = 3)
cutree(hcl, h = 3.9)
identical(cutree(hcl, k = 3), cutree(hcl, h = 3.9))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`



## Pre-processing

Many of the machine learning methods that are regularly used are
sensitive to difference scales. This applies to unsupervised methods
as well as supervised methods, as we will see in the next chapter.

A typical way to pre-process the data prior to learning is to scale
the data, or apply principal component analysis (next section). Scaling
assures that all data columns have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

In R, scaling is done with the `scale` function.

```{r scalesol, fig.width=12, fig.cap=""}
colMeans(mtcars)
hcl1 <- hclust(dist(mtcars))
hcl2 <- hclust(dist(scale(mtcars)))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(hcl1, main = "original data")
plot(hcl2, main = "scaled data")
```
</details>



## Additional exercises

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
An important caveat of clustering is that a clustering algorithm such
as *k-means* will always find clusters, even when there is
none. Illustrate this by creating a 2-dimensional random data by
generation a matrix of 100 rows and 2 columns from *N(0, 1)* and
searching for 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cluster. Visualise these results and assess
whether they look convincing or not.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


```{r, include = FALSE}
xy <- matrix(rnorm(200), ncol = 2)
kcl2 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 2)
kcl3 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 3)
kcl4 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 4)
kcl5 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 5)
kcl6 <- kmeans(xy, centers = 6)
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot(xy)
plot(xy, col = kcl2$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl3$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl4$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl5$cluster)
plot(xy, col = kcl6$cluster)
```


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Using the same value `k = 3`, verify if k-means and hierarchical
clustering produce the same results on the `giris` data.

Which one, if any, is correct?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


```{r iris2algs, fig.width = 12, eval = FALSE}
km <- kmeans(giris[, -5], centers = 3, nstart = 10)
hcl <- hclust(dist(giris[, -5]))
table(km$cluster, cutree(hcl, k = 3))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length, col = km$cluster, main = "k-means")
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length, col = cutree(hcl, k = 3), main = "Hierarchical clustering")
## Checking with the labels provided with the iris data
table(iris$Species, km$cluster)
table(iris$Species, cutree(hcl, k = 3))
```
