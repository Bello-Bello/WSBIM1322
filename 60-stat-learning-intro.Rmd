# Introduction to statistical learning {#sec:mlintro}

The next chapters will focus on statistical (hypothesis testing in
chapter \@ref(sec:testing)) and general machine learning (chapters
\@ref(sec:ul), \@ref(sec:dimred) and \@ref(sec:sl)). Before diving
into the technical details, it is useful to learn (or remind
outselves) why these techniques are so incredibly important when
considering generating and analysing high throughput biomedical
data. Indeed, these tools will not only help in extracting meaningful
results from a data, but (1) understanding what they do, how to apply
them, and their respective limitations, allows to frame the questions
more accurately, and (2) to define what data is needed before
generating it.


Let's start with the following experiment. Researchers are interested
in the expression of three genes,
[A1CF](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=A1CF),
[BRCA1](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BRCA1) and
[TP53](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TP53) in the
absence and presence of a certain drug in a model cell line. The
expression of these genes is measured four times.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "Distributions of the expression of the genes A1CF, BRCA1 and TP53 under the control (no drug) and drug at concentrations 1 and 5."}
expd <- ge <- data.frame(sample = paste0("S", 1:12),
                         group = rep(c("CTRL", "DRUG", "DRUG"), each = 4),
                         concentration = factor(rep(c(0, 1, 5), each = 4)),
                         replicate = rep(1:4, 3),
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
set.seed(1)
ge$A1CF <- rnorm(12, 6, 2)
ge$BRCA1 <- c(abs(rnorm(4, 2, 1)), rnorm(4, 8, 2), rnorm(4, 13, 2))
ge$TP53 <-  c(rnorm(4, 10, 5), rnorm(4, 10, 3), rnorm(4, 10, 2))
ge <- tidyr::gather(ge, key = gene, value = expression, A1CF, BRCA1, TP53)

ggplot2::ggplot(ge, aes(x = concentration, y = expression,
                        colour = concentration, label = replicate)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point() +
        ggplot2::facet_grid(. ~ gene) +
        ggplot2::theme(legend.position="none") +
        ggrepel::geom_text_repel(nudge_x = 0.2, segment.size = 0.5)
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Make sure you understand the visualisation above.

1. What genes would you call differentially expressed, i.e. that show
different expressions between any condition.

2. What criteria do you rely on to conclude whether the genes are or
   aren't differentially expressed?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Now imagine if instead of having 3 genes, we had 20000.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Formalise the experiemental design, i.e. all the variables that define
what the experiment measures using a table.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r expdex1}
knitr::kable(expd)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


Statistical hypothesis testing (chapter in chapter \@ref(sec:testing))
will help us formalise when to call genes differentially expressed.

There are many more types of patterns that we wold be interested in
identifying in omics data. Let's reconsider the linear regression
model from section \@ref(sec:lm). Below is a figure from
@Majumder2013. Among the 20 scatter plots below, one represents the
actual data, and 19 are simulations that are based on the real
data.

- Which plot is the most different from the others, in the sense that
  there is the steepest slope?

- Do you think this is the real data? If it is not, what would you
  conclude as to whether the trend in the real data is relevant or
  not?

```{r regsim, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "One of these plots is the plot of the actual data, and the remaining are null plots, produced by simulating data from a null model that assumes no effect ($H_{0}$ is true)."}
