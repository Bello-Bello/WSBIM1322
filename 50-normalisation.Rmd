# Data normalisation: centering, scaling, quantile normalisation {#sec:norm}

**Learning objectives**

- What is data normalisation and why do we need it?
- What are centering and scaling?
- What is quantile normalisation?
- How to assess if normalisation worked.


In a typical high throughput experiment, we assay thousands of
features (gene transcripts, proteins, metabolites, ...) is a certain
number of biologically diverse samples (from about 6 to hundreds of
thousands).

But what do you think would happen is we took the same sample, such as
a suspension of U2OS cells (a cell line stemming from bone cancer),
split it in two, and measured
